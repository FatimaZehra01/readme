# Flower Project
Flowers are the reproductive structures of flowering plants, known as angiosperms. They come in a wide variety of shapes, sizes, and colors, often attracting pollinators like bees, butterflies, and birds. Each flower typically has several parts, including petals, sepals, stamens (male organs), and carpels (female organs).

Flowers play a crucial role in ecosystems by facilitating reproduction and contributing to biodiversity. They also have cultural significance, symbolizing emotions and events, which is why theyâ€™re often given as gifts or used in ceremonies.
